Is it possible to encourage advertisers to display a non-intrusive barcode or qr with the bare work id? Can the Id become a visual mark for the commons interesting enough to be displayable (imagine a T-shirt with this unique ID showing for example CC-ID#1 and then looking it up online to find that the visual representation of the very same ID to be the licensed work).</p>
